The `zdcf.py` module is a Pyhton 3 version of the ZDCF algorithm for estimation of the cross-correlation function for discrete, sparse astronomical time series. This method was originally proposed and implemented in Fortran by Tal Alxander in 1997 [1][2][3].

## Current status

This repository is **no longer supported or maintained**. The functionality of the `zdcf.py` module is now available in [`pyzdcf`](https://github.com/LSST-sersag/pyzdcf).
